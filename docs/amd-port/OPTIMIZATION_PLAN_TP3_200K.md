# TP3 V340L Optimization Plan - Qwen3.8-27B-ASCII-P1M @ 200k

Date: 2026-09-21. Branch: amd/v340-port-v2 (pin lineage d9df11006 + 24e9e5dc4).
Horizon: up to 6 months, no programming-hour budget.

## Goal and constraints

Goal: >2x decode (17.8 -> 36+ tok/s) and >2x prefill (96.5 -> 200+ tok/s),
holding at BOTH short (2k) and long (10k+) context, in sustained real use.
Config of record: TP3 tensor split + draft-mtp d3, q4_0 KV, FA on, 200k ctx.

Constraints (decided 2026-09-21):
- Weights bit-exact. No requant. (Optional 5-min sanity check: download the
  real Q4_1 ASCII GGUF from HuggingFace and bench it once; expectation low,
  the old 144-vs-97 receipt was a near-zero-context number and capacity at
  200k is why we run the small file.)
- No power-cap or memory-clock games. Better cooling is installed; one
  afternoon of cold/warm/hot re-measurement to refresh the thermal function
  is all the thermal work budgeted. Vega56 BIOS on one card raises power and
  core clocks but memclk will not hold 1k MHz - mclk 945 -> ~183 GB/s/die
  is the permanent bandwidth wall, and everything above it is ALU.
- 4th die is a free helper: draft device, dev/bench cell, or precompute -
  never a 4th TP rank (TP4 measured worse: decode 15.2-15.5 vs 17.8, and AR
  grows with world).

## Baseline truth (measured, see ninfer-history + amd-port receipts)

- Decode cycle at MTP d3: ~175 ms for 3.12 accepted tokens. Kernel census:
  86.2% mul_mat_vec_q (MMVQ), 4.6% quantize_q8_1, 3.3% flash_attn. Zero
  rocBLAS. Effective MMVQ bandwidth ~30 GB/s vs 183.8 GB/s/die measured
  ceiling -> fat-tier-loss verdict: the deficit is kernel execution, not
  physics. Ideal cycle ~21-25 ms -> ~7x headroom on the dominant kernel.
- Prefill: 67.4% rocBLAS fp16 GEMM at ~1.7-2 TF/s/die vs ~21.5 TF/s/die
  packed-fp16 peak (no MFMA on gfx900; VALU fp16x2 only), 24.4% flash_attn,
  allreduce 12-21% of wall. AR today = meta-backend butterfly staged through
  host memory (no P2P, canAccessPeer=0 all pairs, ~50 us/hop latency, PCIe
  3.0 x8 per card ~15.75 GB/s/dir). The fast one-shot host-pinned AR design
  (allreduce.cu) exists in-tree but is compiled out on HIP
  (`#if !defined(GGML_USE_HIP)`).
- GDN: 48 of 64 trunk layers are recurrent; graph shows per-layer chains of
  small kernels (ssm_conv, ssm_scan, l2_norm, silu/softplus/mul glue) that
  are unmeasured on this port at decode batch 4.
- MTP draft: per draft step the head re-runs a full attention block + FFN +
  the 0.5 GiB q6_K LM head on the same 3 dies, serialized before the verify
  pass. 3 draft steps per cycle at accept 0.708.
- Thermal: new cooling; expected flatter cold/hot curve, to be re-stamped
  once (W1). Historic function was 1.65-2.8x cold/hot - verify, don't assume.

## Method

Every optimization cell runs the ninfer-kernel-opt protocol: lock env,
reproduce baseline (+-2%), one rocprof capture squeezed to death, classify
the bound (weight-bytes floor AND compute floor, plus the four-ablation kit
where counters are unreliable on gfx900), pull ladder rungs in yield order,
gate every arm same-BIN behind an env switch with >=3 interleaved reps and an
in-run control (>1% drift = void session), bank a receipt for wins AND
negatives, stop only at a named measured ceiling. The 4th die is the
permanent dev/bench cell so serving windows are never disturbed.

## Workstreams

### W0 - Harness (week 1-2)
- bench.sh: cold/warm-stamped llama-bench + server protocol (3-min idle
  rule), 2k/10k/50k/200k ladder, decode+pp+acceptance per run.
- Census script: rocprof around one canonical request per phase (decode-
  verify, draft, prefill), kernels ranked by total seconds, plus GPU-idle
  timeline (launch-gap share) and AR latency histogram.
- Correctness battery: 8-needle long-context check + MTP acceptance canary
  (gate 0.708 at 2k, fail at -4pp). Every promoted arm re-runs it.
- Route banner: per-config print of split/world/spec/quant so receipts
  self-attribute.

### W1 - Config and environment wins (week 1-3, existing binary)
- --spec-draft-backend-sampling (GPU-side draft sampling; kills per-step
  vocab-logits host roundtrips, 129k-wide f32).
- ubatch sweep 128/256/512 at 2k/10k/200k with thermal stamps.
- Host tuning: CPU affinity for HIP driver threads, NUMA local to the PCIe
  roots of the three dies; env matrix (GGML_CUDA_ALLREDUCE,
  GGML_CUDA_PDL, OP_OFFLOAD_MIN_BATCH).
- One-afternoon thermal re-stamp (cold/warm/hot prefill+decode) with the
  new cooling; update the thermal leaflet numbers.
- Optional: the 5-min HF Q4_1 bench (closes the format question).
- Expected: decode 19-22, pp 105-125.

### W2 - MMVQ decode engine (month 1-3, the big one)
Target: mul_mat_vec_q for this file's exact (qtype, K, T) cells at T=1..8.
Bound expectation: latency/occupancy + decode-ALU (LUT unpack chains on
wave64, sub-wave grids on 56 CUs). Ladder, in order:
1. C2/C1 K-split (cross-CTA first; ninfer measured +32-58% on sub-wave
   serial chains; many-wave rows expected dead - band by measurement).
2. A2 128-bit coalesced loads (uint4-per-lane; sector math).
3. A3 LDS double-buffer prefetch (cp.async concept, software pipelining).
4. B1 v_perm_b32 byte-permute decode atom (PRMT analog) for the 3-bit iq
   LUT chains; count SASS inst/weight before and after.
5. C4 launch_bounds/occupancy budget (+1 KiB smem pad law).
6. C7 per-shape qualification: pin winners for K in {5120, 6144, 10240,
   12288, 17408} x T in {1..8}; fail loud off-list.
Priority by bytes: iq3_s (3.39 GiB), iq4_xs (3.12), iq3_xxs (2.35), q4_K
(1.58), q6_K head (0.55). All arms behind env switches; oracle = bit-exact
math so no acceptance price.
Exit: >=100 GB/s effective on the top-3 types, decode share re-censused.

### W3 - GDN chain + glue (month 2-3)
- Census the recurrent chain at decode batch 4 on die 4 (dev cell): kernel
  list, gap share, per-op us for ssm_conv / ssm_scan / norm / glue.
- Fuse per-layer elementwise glue (norm+silu+mul, sigmoid+mul) into the
  neighboring ops; single fused GDN-recurrent kernel candidate if the
  census says the chain dominates.
- Verify cparams.fused_gdn_ar / fused_gdn_ch are active on this port.
- Kill quantize_q8_1 (4.6% of decode): emit q8_1 activations directly from
  the producing norm kernel where the MMVQ path allows.
- Prefill half: chunked GDN scan (ninfer measured x16 on the dn column) if
  the prefill census shows ssm-scan share.

### W4 - Allreduce fast path (month 2-4)
- Port allreduce.cu (2-GPU pinned-host one-shot) to HIP; generalize to 3
  ranks; wire as the meta-backend AR for small payloads, butterfly kept as
  fixture behind env. Respect the CLOSED SET: no one-shot wedges (acceptance
  drift), no fp8-ring numerics, no copy-add.
- Then chunked pipelined butterfly for prefill (split M; reduce slice k
  while computing k+1) to hide the 12-21% AR share.
- Expected: -10-20 ms/decode cycle at ~130 ARs x ~40 KB; prefill +10-15%.

### W5 - Prefill engine (month 2-5)
- GEMM: bench rocBLAS on the exact shapes (M=ubatch, K=5120/17408, N=per-die
  row share). If <50% of achievable, write packed-fp16 VALU tiles per the
  GEMM_CONSTRAINED_TILES_2026-09-18 spec (32 flop/cyc/SIMD bound; 56 CU x
  4 SIMD x 32 = 10.75 TF/s/die fp32-class realistic top) instead of fighting
  Tensile. Pre-quantize activations once per tile, not per GEMM.
- FA: 13 fattn-tile instances exist for hd=256 GQA 24:4; bench all, retune
  the winner for 56 CUs (tile/wave sizing), target the 24.4% share.
- Long-context: measure pp at 50k/100k/200k after W4 overlap lands; the
  mild context scaling (17.8@2k -> 15.6@10k) should hold to 200k.

### W6 - 4th die as draft device (month 3-5)
Primary: run the draft-mtp context (nextn block + shared head + its KV,
~0.9 GiB) on die 3, overlapping draft steps with the verify pass on the TP3
dies. Needs: device pinning for the draft context in speculative.cpp, small
KV/state sync (last-token hidden state + accepted tokens), and the draft
graph's 0.5 GiB LM head staying on die 3. Removes draft time (roughly a
third of the cycle at accept 0.708, 3.12 tok/step) from the critical path.
Fallback if overlap stalls: die 3 stays the dev/bench cell (already paid
for by W0-W2).
After W2-W4 land, re-sweep TP2/TP3/TP4 - the balance shifts once kernels
stop dominating, and KV headroom at TP2 returns if MTP moves off-box.

### W7 - Long-context gating + delivery (month 4-6)
- Full 2k/10k/50k/100k/200k curves at every milestone; q4_0 KV kept
  (3.9 GiB at 200k; hybrid model scales mildly).
- Watch logits buffer at -b 256+ (512 x 129,272 x f32 = 264 MB); confirm
  inp_out_ids gating active in the MTP path.
- Sustained-rate characterization (the user-facing number): 30/60-min soaks
  at 10k and 200k, receipts with cold/hot labels.

## Milestones

- M1 (end week 3): harness live, W1 banked. Decode 19-22, pp 105-125.
- M2 (end month 2): W2 first blood (K-split + wide loads on iq3_s/iq4_xs/
  iq3_xxs), W4 initial port. Decode 26-32, pp 130-160.
- M3 (end month 4): W2/W3/W4 complete, W5a+5b in. Decode 35-45, pp 200-260.
  Both 2x gates green at 2k AND 10k.
- M4 (month 6): W6 draft overlap + sustained characterization. Decode 40+
  stretch, receipts complete.

## Verification gates (every arm, no exceptions)

Same-BIN env-switch A/B, >=3 interleaved reps, in-run control, median per
axis-class, noise classes <2% not-movement / 2-5% must-label / >=5%
unambiguous. Oracle bit-equality for exact kernels; acceptance price +
served-content equality for anything that changes numerics; needle battery
+ MTP canary before any promotion; old arm stays alive behind its switch;
every rate row self-attributes; receipts in docs/amd-port/results/.

## Closed set (do not re-open without new evidence)

graph capture (twice), fp8-ring AR numerics, one-shot AR wedges, copy-add
AR, pinned-high clocks (1.3-1.8x backfire at 110 W), kT-widening without
occupancy data, smem LUT decode post-K-split, RCCL env matrix, static-count
projections as rate claims, requantizing the shipped file.

## Risks

- rocprof counter limits on gfx900: the four-ablation kit needs no hardware
  counters (pure-consume, k-scaling, T-scaling, CTA-tiling).
- Meta-backend surgery breaks TP3 boot: arms staged behind env; butterfly
  kept as fixture; die 4 dev cell catches this before serving windows.
- Decode ceiling ~60-90 tok/s (memclk-bound once kernels are fixed): 2x has
  margin even if W6 slips; prefill ceiling is ALU-bound -> custom tiles
  budgeted in W5.
- Upstream drift: pin lineage, cherry-pick only; the port is 2 code commits.

## First week, concretely

1. W0 scripts (bench protocol, census, control cells) on die 4.
2. W1 flag sweeps on the existing binary (backend-sampling, ubatch, env).
3. W2 P1 classification: census the decode pass; run the byte-floor +
   ablation kit on the iq3_s 17408x5120-class and iq4_xs cells.
4. File receipts; update this doc's baseline numbers with the W1 re-stamp.

## PROGRESS LEDGER (append-only)

Law: this ledger is the current state of the campaign. New entries are
APPENDED at the end, never edited or removed; corrections are new entries
that supersede. Each entry: id, date, one-line state, receipt pointers.
Agent-work law: agents work in git worktrees on side branches (never the
main tree), one worktree per workstream; served world (dies 0,1,2) belongs
to Gemini's guard battery, die 3 is the dev cell.

- E-001 2026-09-21 W0 baseline reproduced: TP3-tensor 10k no-spec pp 94.69 /
  tg128 12.24 (new receipt cell). results/W0_baseline_tp3_tensor_10k.txt
- E-002 2026-09-21 W0 decode census banked (rocprofv3; absolute-path lesson):
  MMVQ 77% of decode kernel budget; allreduce only ~6% (W4 demoted); GDN
  5.6%; targets named. Correction: the 249 us/call rows are FUSED-GLU
  variants, not small_k. results/W0_census_decode_receipt.md
- E-003 2026-09-21 Guard suite landed (Gemini, modeled on dual_5060_ti_ninfer)
  and validated GREEN on first run: pp 93.77 / decode 15.31 / accept 0.6667
  (== PLOG-101 receipt). Hardening assigned: thermal sideband, version-lock,
  prefill-first ordering, cache_prompt=false. docs/amd-port/tests/
- E-004 2026-09-21 Fusion A/B banked: fused-GLU MMVQ stays (decode 16.21 vs
  14.66 t/s mean without it, -8% consistent); prefill leg VOID (monotone
  thermal drift 49.8->55.9 across arms). results/AB_fusion_off_2026-09-21.md
- E-005 2026-09-21 W2 microbench cell banked (bench_mmvq_gfx900.cu, die 3):
  shipped clone 105.2 GB/s = 1.75x off sequential floor. SEVEN schedule
  rungs NEGATIVE: LDS-LUT, balanced slots, NW4, NW8, multi-row r2/r4/r8,
  NW1 r4/r8, ILP2 x2. results/W2_mmvq_cell_2026-09-21.md
- E-006 2026-09-21 Pure-consume ablation names the wall: coalesced 327 GB/s;
  same-geometry loads 245 (pattern NOT the wall); +constant-LUT 178 (-28%);
  full decode 105 (-41% further). Door: decode-atom redesign, target
  130-150 GB/s, bit-exact integer atom preferred.
- E-007 2026-09-21 Incident + law: stale per-tensor byte figure (28.2 MB vs
  real 38.3 MB) -> OOB bench reads -> memory fault -> numbers void. LAW:
  per-tensor sizes come from offset deltas (next_offset - offset), never
  recomputed formulas. GGUF layout verified standard (866/866 tensors).
- E-008 2026-09-21 Protocol adopted (user-directed): agents work in git
  worktrees on side branches; this ledger is the append-only current state;
  timer automation (every 30 min) drives progress without user input.
- E-009 2026-09-21 Worktree + agent split (user-directed protocol): worktree
  /media/chris/ssd128/llamacpp/wt-decode-atom on branch amd/w2-decode-atom
  dispatched to the W2 decode-atom desk (oracle-first mandate, target
  >=130 GB/s on the iq3_s cell, die 3 only). Gemini retains dies 0-2 for the
  served guard battery and its hardening tasks. Timer automation (30 min)
  now carries this protocol.
- E-010 2026-09-21 Hardened battery + cold-stamp baseline re-run validated GREEN:
  version-fingerprint ab3dfba685c5cfb7, session lock enforced, 5s thermal sideband
  (109 samples, drift +47.0C, max edge 85C/junc 90C). 180s idle cooldown executed;
  all 5 guards PASS: cold-stamped pp 93.87 t/s (-2.72% vs 96.50), decode 15.34 t/s
  (-1.47% vs 15.57), MTP accept 0.6667 (gate >=0.63), greedy determinism byte-identical
  (sha256 4beb1ba25219ee9b), needle recall 3/3 exact ([25, 50, 75]%). W0/W1 test harness
  setup officially closed. Receipt: results/tp3_guards_20260921_141900.jsonl,
  thermal log: results/tp3_guards_20260921_141900_thermal.log

- E-010 2026-09-21 (recorded by ZCode from Gemini msg #1316; Gemini's own
  copy did not land in-tree) Battery hardening + cold-stamp baseline re-run
  COMPLETE: 5/5 guards GREEN - cold prefill 93.87, decode 15.34, accept
  0.6667, determinism byte-identical, needle 3/3. Thermal sideband banked
  (109 samples). Battery fingerprint ab3dfba685c5. Receipt:
  results/tp3_guards_20260921_141900.jsonl (+ _thermal.log). This is the
  official baseline of record for all future arms. W0/W1 setup CLOSED.
- E-011 2026-09-21 Second worktree dispatched: wt-prefill-gemm on branch
  amd/w5-prefill-gemm for the W5 prefill desk (rocBLAS shape survey +
  GEMM microbench harness authoring, NO GPU runs while the W2 decode-atom
  desk holds die 3; benching deferred until W2 integration is recorded
  in this ledger). Decode-atom agent still running (no report yet).
- E-012 2026-09-21 W5 zero-GPU phase COMPLETE (desk: wt-prefill-gemm). Shape census
  banked from the GGUF header + qwen35.cpp graph: 48 GDN + 16 attn layers; attn_q
  5120x12288 carries q+gate fused; TP3 row-split rounds per-die shares to 128-row
  blocks (get_mmq_y_host gfx900), canonical shares e.g. 17408 -> 5760/5760/5888. Trunk
  = 6.23 TFLOP/ubatch (48.7 GFLOP/tok, ~2.04 TFLOP/die); FFN gate/up/down = 70.3% of
  GEMM FLOPs, then gdn_qkv 10.3%, ssm_out+gdn_gate 6.2% each. Dispatch survey: every
  dense prefill GEMM runs dequant-to-f16 + hipBLAS f16-acc/f16-out (gfx900 MMQ
  disabled dense by rule mmq.cu:371-376; FORCE_MMQ/CUBLAS are compile-time only);
  implied served rate ~2.0-2.2 TF/s/die vs 10.75-12.5 fp32-class / ~21.5 packed-fp16
  ceilings, so the custom packed-fp16 tile route stays W5-live pending the bench gate.
  Harness READY, compile-validated for gfx900, NOT RUN: die-3 runs deferred until the
  W2 desk releases the cell. Receipt: results/W5_gemm_survey_2026-09-21.md;
  harness: tests/bench_gemm_gfx900.cu (census table + build line in header).
- E-013 2026-09-21 Integration: amd/w5-prefill-gemm merged into
  amd/v340-port-v2 (merge resolved at the ledger tail; duplicate E-010
  entries kept - same fact, recorded independently, both stand under
  append-only). W5 zero-GPU phase ACCEPTED: shape census (FFN trio = 70.3%
  of GEMM FLOPs, 6.23 TFLOP/ubatch), rocBLAS harness ready
  (tests/bench_gemm_gfx900.cu, compile-validated, deferred die-3 run),
  survey finding of record: dense prefill GEMMs run dequant-to-f16 +
  hipBLAS f16-acc/f16-out every call (mmq.cu:371-376 rule) - the f16
  dequant write traffic (~16 GB/die/ubatch) is a newly-named prefill
  target. GPU phase queued behind W2 decode-atom desk.
